# IG-unfollowers-Selenium
To find out that who unfollowed me on instagram i developed that script with using Python & Selenium. This script takes your followers and following lists as a text file and compare the differences. 
If you wanna use that script you have to take off your 2FA protection.
Second requirement is you need to install gecko driver for your Firefox Browser.
